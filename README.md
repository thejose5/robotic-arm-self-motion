# Robotic Arm Self Motion

This project was a personal learning project I worked on to develop an understanding of ROS development using C++, Gazebo and Moveit. The goal of the project was to enable self motion in a robotic arm. Self motion refers to moving the robotic arm without changing the coordinates of the end effector.
